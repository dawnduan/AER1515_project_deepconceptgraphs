The window has horizontal blinds partially closed. \n\nOn the right side of the room, there is a wooden cabinet with a light brown finish. The cabinet has three drawers, each with a horizontal handle. On top of the cabinet, there are a few items: a blue object, possibly a book or a folder, and a transparent plastic bag containing some items. \n\nNext to the cabinet, there is a wicker basket placed on the floor. The basket appears to be empty. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a white, fluffy rug partially visible, suggesting that the room might be used for relaxation or as a waiting area. The walls of the room are painted in a light color, and the baseboards are black, creating a simple and clean aesthetic."

On the right side of the room, there is a wooden dresser with three drawers, each featuring a round, wooden knob. On top of the dresser, there are a few items, including a blue object and a white object wrapped in plastic. Next to the dresser, there is a woven basket. The walls are painted in a light color, and the baseboards are black. The room appears to be a part of a larger facility, possibly a medical or research facility, given the utilitarian design and the presence of the dresser and basket."
